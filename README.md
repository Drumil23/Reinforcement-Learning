# Reinforcement Learning Labs and Project

This repository contains lab exercises and a project for the Reinforcement Learning course.

## Structure

### Stable Baselines
- [Stable-Baselines](Stable-Baselines/): Examples using the Stable Baselines library
  - [CartPole implementation](Stable-Baselines/cartpole.ipynb)

### Project
- [Project](Project/): Final project implementation
  - [app.py](Project/app.py): Application interface
  - [main.py](Project/main.py): Main execution file
  - [rl.py](Project/rl.py): Reinforcement learning algorithms
  - [test.py](Project/test.py): Testing scripts

## Getting Started

To run the Jupyter notebooks:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

To run the Python scripts:
```bash
python Project/main.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyTorch (for some experiments)
- Gym/Gymnasium (for reinforcement learning environments)
- Stable Baselines (for the Stable-Baselines examples)
